Sellers must deliver completed files and/or proof of work using the Deliver Work button (located on the Order page) according to the service that was purchased and advertised on their Product.

Using the Deliver Work button may not be abused by sellers to circumvent Order guidelines described in this Terms of Service. Using the “Product Shipped” button when an order was not fulfilled may result in a cancellation of that order after review, affect the seller’s rating and result in a warning to seller.

An order is marked as complete after the order is marked as Delivered and then rated by a buyer. An order will be automatically marked as complete if not rated and no request for modification was submitted within 3 days after marked as Delivered.

We encourage our buyers and sellers to try and settle conflicts amongst themselves. If for any reason this fails after using the Resolution Center or if you encounter non-permitted usage on the Site, users can contact Alphabit’s Customer Support department for assistance here.

Handling Orders
When a buyer orders a Product, the seller is notified by email as well as notifications on the site while logged into the account.

Sellers are required to meet the delivery time they specified when creating their Products. Failing to do so will allow the buyer to cancel the order when an order is marked as late and may harm the seller’s status.Sellers must send completed files and/or proof of work using the Deliver Completed Work button (located on the Order page) to mark the order as Delivered.

Users are responsible for scanning all transferred files for viruses and malware. Alphabit will not be held responsible for any damages which might occur due to site usage, use of content or files transferred.A Seller may cancel an order without the buyer’s consent at any given moment (Force Cancellation).

However, this will have a negative effect on the seller’s status.Buyers may use the “Request Revisions” feature located on the Order page while an order is marked as Delivered if the delivered materials do not match the seller’s description on their Product page or they do not match the requirements sent to the seller at the beginning of the order process.

Reviews
Feedback reviews provided by buyers while completing an order are an essential part of Alphabit’s rating system. Reviews demonstrate the buyer’s overall experience with the sellers and their service. Buyers are encouraged to communicate to the seller any concerns experienced during their active order in regards to the service provided by the seller.

Leaving a buyer’s feedback is a basic prerogative of a buyer. Feedback reviews will not be removed unless there are clear violations to our Terms of Service.To prevent any misuse of our Feedback system, all feedback reviews must come from legitimate sales executed exclusively through the Alphabit platform from users within our Community. Purchases arranged, determined to artificially enhance seller ratings, or to abuse the Alphabit platform with purchases from additional accounts, will result in a permanent suspension of all related accounts.

Feedback comments given by buyers are publicly displayed on a seller’s Product page. Buyers have the option not to include a comment, but still rate the service. Cancellation of an order does not remove feedback unless mutually agreed.

Withholding the delivery of services, files, or information required to complete the Product’s service with the intent to gain favorable reviews or additional services is prohibited.

Responding and posting a review: Once work is delivered, the buyer has three days to respond and post a review (or 14 days for Products with shipping).

Ownership
Ownership and limitations: Unless clearly stated otherwise on the seller’s Product page/description, when the work is delivered, and subject to payment, the buyer is granted all intellectual property rights, including but not limited to, copyrights for the work delivered from the seller, and the seller waives any and all moral rights therein. The delivered work shall be considered work-for-hire under the U.S. Copyright Act. In the event the delivered work does not meet the requirements of work-for-hire or when US Copyright Act does not apply, the seller expressly agrees to assign to buyer the copyright in the delivered work. All transfer and assignment of intellectual property to buyer shall be subject to full payment for the Product and the delivery may not be used if payment is cancelled for any reason. For removal of doubt, in custom created work (such as art work, design work, report generation etc.), the delivered work shall be the exclusive property of buyer, and seller assigns all rights, title and interest in the delivered work. Some Products (including for custom created work) charge additional payments (through Product Extras) for a Commercial Use License. This means that if you purchase the Product for personal use, you will own all rights you require for such use, and will not need the Commercial Use License. If you intend to use it for any charge or other consideration, or for any purpose that is directly or indirectly in connection with any business, or other undertaking intended for profit, you will need to buy the Commercial Use License through a Product Extra and will have broader rights that cover your business use.

For Voice Over Products, when the work is delivered, and subject to payment, the buyer is purchasing basic rights, (which means the buyer is paying a one time fee allowing them to use the work forever and for any purpose except for commercials, radio, television and internet commercial spots). If you intend to use the Voice Over to promote a product and/or service (with the exception of paid marketing channels), you will need to purchase the Commercial Rights (Buy-Out) through Product Extra. If you intend to use the Voice Over in radio, television and internet commercials, you will need to purchase the Full Broadcast Rights (Buy-Out) through Product Extra.

Sellers further confirm that whatever information they receive from the buyer, which is not public domain, shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared or used for any purpose whatsoever other than for the delivery of the ordered work to the buyer.

Furthermore, users (both buyers and sellers) agree that unless they explicitly indicate otherwise, the content users voluntarily create/upload to Alphabit, including Product texts, photos, videos, usernames, user photos, user videos and any other information, including the display of delivered work, may be used by Alphabit for no consideration for marketing and/or other purposes.

Voice Over Commercial Buy-Out
When purchasing a Voice Over Product, the Seller grants you a perpetual, exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to use the purchased Voice Over (except for commercials, radio, television and internet commercial spots).

By purchasing a Commercial Rights (Buy-Out) with your order, in addition to the basic rights, the Seller grants you with a license to use the Voice Over for any corporate, promotional and non-broadcast purposes.
